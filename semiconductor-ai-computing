## ðŸ’¡ Semiconductor Industry | AI Computation & Hardware Trends

This project explores the evolution of computation in large AI models, analyzing how hardware capabilities and compute scaling have accelerated across organizations and models. Using Python (Jupyter Notebook), SQL, and Tableau, I uncover trends in training computation (petaFLOPs), model efficiency (MMLU scores), and cross-organization investment in AI development.
